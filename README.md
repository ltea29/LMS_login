# LMS_login

Testing this out to see if I can get it to work!

So far I have the login screen and the usernames and passwords are linked to the Microsoft SQL Express I have downloaded.  You can easily
create your own table and just change the source to have the program base it on your data table.

I was able to find code on youtube that opened the student's dashboard once you logged in with the correct username and password.
